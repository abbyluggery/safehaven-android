## National Organizations

### National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV)

**Why Partner**:
- 2,000+ member organizations nationwide
- Policy advocacy at federal level
- Technology initiative (Safety Net Project)

**Value Proposition to NNEDV**:
```
"SafeHaven fills a critical gap: Most DV apps assume white, cisgender,
heterosexual women. Trans BIPOC survivors have NO app designed for them.
SafeHaven's intersectional resource matching ensures NO survivor is left
behind. We align with NNEDV's commitment to inclusive, survivor-centered
services."
```

**Ask**:
1. Endorsement (logo, "NNEDV-approved")
2. Referrals to member organizations
3. Presentation at annual conference
4. Joint grant applications (VAWA funding)

**Status**: 🔄 Initial contact made, awaiting response

---

### National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP)

**Why Partner**:
- LGBTQ+ DV specialization (exactly our target)
- 50+ member organizations
- Strong trans survivor advocacy

**Value Proposition to NCAVP**:
```
"SafeHaven was built WITH trans survivors, not FOR them. We prioritize
trans-inclusive resources, use chosen names (not legal names), and address
outing as an abuse tactic. NCAVP endorsement signals to LGBTQ+ survivors
that SafeHaven is TRULY affirming, not just rainbow-washing."
```

**Ask**:
1. MOU partnership
2. Promote SafeHaven to member organizations
3. Survivor beta testing recruitment
4. Annual data report on LGBTQ+ DV tech use

**Status**: ✅ MOU signed (Month 6)

---

### National Indigenous Women's Resource Center (NIWRC)

**Why Partner**:
- 574 federally recognized tribes (each with unique DV resources)
- Understanding of tribal sovereignty issues
- Cultural competence training

**Value Proposition to NIWRC**:
```
"Tribal survivors face unique barriers: Jurisdiction complexities, limited
resources on reservations, and cultural considerations. SafeHaven includes
tribal-specific resources and explains VAWA tribal provisions. We seek
NIWRC's guidance to ensure cultural appropriateness."
```

**Ask**:
1. Tribal resource vetting (verify accuracy)
2. Cultural competence review (avoid appropriation)
3. Connection to tribal DV coordinators
4. Endorsement for tribal communities

**Status**: 🔄 Outreach in progress

---

### Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence (API-GBV)

**Why Partner**:
- 20+ Asian languages supported
- Cultural-specific DV dynamics (e.g., shame, family honor)
- Immigration expertise (U-Visa, VAWA)

**Value Proposition to API-GBV**:
```
"Asian survivors face language barriers and cultural stigma. SafeHaven
supports 20+ languages (including Mandarin, Korean, Tagalog, Vietnamese)
and prioritizes API-led organizations. We need API-GBV's expertise to
ensure cultural competence."
```

**Ask**:
1. Language review (ensure accurate translations)
2. Cultural competence consultation
3. Connection to API DV organizations
4. Joint webinar on tech + API survivors

**Status**: 🔄 Pending outreach

## Local/Regional Partners

### Target Cities (Phase 1)

## Technology Partners

### Google.org (Tech for Social Good)

**Why Partner**:
- $200,000 grant potential
- Google Cloud credits (server costs)
- Engineering support (Googlers volunteer time)

**Value Proposition to Google**:
```
"SafeHaven uses cutting-edge Android tech (Jetpack Compose, CameraX,
Room) to solve a critical social problem. Unlike most DV apps, we center
the most marginalized survivors. Google's support amplifies impact for
trans BIPOC women—the highest-risk, lowest-resourced group."
```

**Ask**:
1. $200,000 grant (tech development)
2. Google Cloud credits ($50,000/year)

---

### AWS (Cloud Storage for Evidence Backup)

**Why Partner**:
- S3 for encrypted evidence backup
- AWS credits for nonprofits

**Value Proposition to AWS**:
```
"Survivors need secure, redundant evidence storage. If phone is destroyed,
cloud backup preserves court-ready evidence. AWS S3's 99.999999999%
durability ensures evidence is never lost. This literally saves lives."
```

**Ask**:
1. AWS Activate credits ($100,000)
2. Solution architecture support (optimal S3 setup)
3. Case study feature (AWS blog)

**Status**: 🔄 Applied for Activate credits

### Polygon (Blockchain Timestamping)

**Why Partner**:
- Low gas fees for document hashing
- Verifiable, immutable timestamps
- Fast transactions (2 seconds)

**Value Proposition to Polygon**:
```
"SafeHaven demonstrates real-world blockchain use: Court-admissible
evidence timestamping. Unlike crypto speculation, this saves lives.
Polygon's low fees make blockchain accessible for social good."
```

**Ask**:
1. Marketing partnership (case study)
2. Grant from Polygon Social Impact fund
3. Technical support (web3 integration)

**Status**: 🔄 Pending outreach
