# NeuroThrive SafeHaven - Complete Documentation

## Mission
Provide free, encrypted, intersectional safety planning technology for ALL domestic violence survivors—regardless of gender identity, race, sexual orientation, disability, or economic status.

## What is SafeHaven?
SafeHaven is a comprehensive domestic violence safety planning platform that includes:
- **Android Mobile App**: Hidden evidence vault, silent documentation, panic delete
- **Web Portal**: Computer access for survivors without safe phone access  
- **SMS System**: Text-based resources for low-tech access
- **Career Integration**: Job search tools for economic independence
- **Verified Documents**: Cryptographic verification of legal documents
- **Intersectional Resources**: 1,000+ BIPOC/LGBTQIA+/male survivor-specific resources

## Key Features
✅ **Silent Documentation**: No camera sounds, GPS off by default, no evidence left on phone  
✅ **Verified Document Copies**: SHA-256 + blockchain timestamping for birth certificates, etc.  
✅ **Intersectional Design**: Built for most marginalized first (trans BIPOC women, undocumented, disabled)  
✅ **Gender-Neutral**: Serves all genders (women, men, non-binary survivors)  
✅ **Economic Empowerment**: Integrated job search = financial independence  
✅ **100% Free**: 501(c)(3) nonprofit, no paywalls ever
