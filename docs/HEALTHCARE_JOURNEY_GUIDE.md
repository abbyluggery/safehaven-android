# SafeHaven Healthcare Journey Planning Guide

## Overview

SafeHaven's Healthcare Journey Planning feature helps domestic violence survivors safely access reproductive healthcare in a post-Roe v. Wade America. This feature recognizes that **reproductive healthcare access is a safety issue** for survivors, as research shows DV escalates dramatically with unwanted pregnancy.

## Why This Feature Matters

**The Reality:**
- Reproductive coercion is a common DV tactic
- Unwanted pregnancy increases risk of severe violence
- Many survivors need to travel out-of-state for reproductive healthcare
- Travel requires careful planning: clinic, housing, childcare, transportation, funding

**Our Solution:**
SafeHaven coordinates your complete healthcare journey with maximum privacy protection.
